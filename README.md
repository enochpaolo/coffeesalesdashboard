This project is an interactive dashboard coffee sales monitoring for a fictitious coffee shop using Microsoft Excel.

I made this by following Mo Chen's video instructions which can be found in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m13o5aqeCbM&list=PLodYDTuHA29aa_5UPCNg_g5fyleHxTZPU&index=6. I just adjusted a few formula here and there and made some aesthetic changes. But I want to give all the credit to him.
